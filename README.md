## 1. Introduction

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is the world's premier T20 cricket tournament, attracting top talent and massive audiences globally. With 17+ seasons of rich player, match, and venue data, IPL is a goldmine for analytics. This project transforms raw IPL data into interactive dashboards that help fans, analysts, and franchises gain deep insights into the game's performance metrics and strategies.

Manual analysis of historical performance is inefficient and often leads to missed insights. There’s a need for an end-to-end analytical dashboard to explore team and player performance, venue behavior, and season trends effectively.
